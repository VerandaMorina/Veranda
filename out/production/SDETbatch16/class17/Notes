Constuctor:

     Is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
     It is used too initialize the object with the values provided as argumentsto the constructor.
     If no constructor is defined in a class, a default constructor.

Rules:
      1)Constructor must be the same name as the class.
      2)Constructors dont have return types not even void.
      3)When we dont create one Java creates a default one
