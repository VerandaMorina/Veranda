Rules about variables:
                      -We cant have same name variables twice in a java class or method. VD1
                      -Java is caseSensitive which means for java age and AGE are two totally different things. VD2
                      -We can update the value of a variable as many times as we want to refer to Variables.
                       example class VD3
                       int age=80;
                       age=81; we are updating
                      -if we want to print multiple variables in a single line we can use Sring concatenation. Refer to SRDemo
